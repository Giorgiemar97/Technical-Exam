To do list
-Check that the applications are working as they should (DONE!)
-Create a Kubernetes cluster (DONE!)

-Containerize the application using Docker (In progress) 
a. Making sure to build the app - Kept getting an error on load build context cancelled.
b. Making sure to put it into the container 
c. Testing the app. (docker run -p 3000:3000 my-app:v1.0)
-Push the container image to a Container Registry 
a. Need to log into Docker hub
b. Make sure to tag the image one wants
c. Push the image into the hub using my credentials (docker push Giorgiemar97/node-hostname:v1.0 )
d. You can see the image either on your Docker home or you can pull it up using (docker run Giorgiemar97/node-hostname:v1.0 )
-Run the application inside your Kubernetes cluster 
a. Create a deployment file
b. Create a service to expose the app

Extra (just in case one has time):
- Expose the application via https (and not http)
- Make a trivial change to the application and do a rolling update
